- Created by the merchants from [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]]'s [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Districts of Silden/District of Divination\|District of Divination]]
- It's a set of 36 huge obsidian obelisks that was build under the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Artificial Sun\|Artificial Sun]] orbit. Each monolith is placed equal distance from each other, the distance is equal to the sun's movement in 240 hours.
- Each monolith is equipped with a lens and metal sheet set on a moving table that moves the sheet few centimetres each year. Whenever the sun is directly above a monolith, it burns a small hole into the metal sheet, these sheets are later used to calibrate clocks across the world.
- Monolith is a measurement of time that indicates 240 hours or 10 days.
