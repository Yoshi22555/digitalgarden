- Unlike most other cities on Dilaria, [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]]'s temperature isn't controlled by massive [[Items & Concepts/Salur\|Salur]] lanterns but instead by a group of powerful sorcerers called [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenari\|Lenari]] who entered a trance stance in which they focus their entire beings on upholding [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/thermal shield\|thermal shield]], which is an arcane dome that both regulates the temperature of the city, functions as a wall that protects the city and allows the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenari Palace\|Lenari Palace]] to fly above the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Heart of Lenturia\|Heart of Lenturia]].

Characteristics of people of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]]:
- Citizens from the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia upper city\|Lenturia upper city]] are proud of their heritage, since they are the descendants of [[Characters/Students of Tenazir\|Students of Tenazir]].
- Citizens from the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia upper city\|Lenturia upper city]] believe themselves to be above those who are not naturally connected to the weave. They see them as forsaken by gods.
- Despite valuing innate magical prowess, citizens of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia upper city\|Lenturia upper city]] also value education a lot especially education in magic, the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/flying universities of Lenturia\|flying universities of Lenturia]] are on par with [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]]'s districts of magic, but focus on magic as a whole instead of specific schools of magics, which is why most citizens of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia upper city\|Lenturia upper city]] are generalist sorcerers.
- Citizens of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia upper city\|Lenturia upper city]] respect the law and find beauty in well oiled legislative machines.
- On the other hand citizens of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia Slums\|Lenturia Slums]] often despise magic, because of the oppression they experience from [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/enlightened citizens\|enlightened citizens]].
- Citizens of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia Slums\|Lenturia Slums]] live in close communities where neighbours tend to help each other.
- In [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia Slums\|Lenturia Slums]] the law isn't respected, most people follow the moral codes of either religions or their ancestors but they don't care for following the rules established by the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/enlightened court\|enlightened court]], which is why crime is a common occurrence especially against [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/enlightened citizens\|enlightened citizens]]. 
- Citizens of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]] mostly worship the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Heart of Lenturia\|Heart of Lenturia]] believing that it is a gift from [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]] who was sent by the gods to guide them. They don't name any particular god, but in their prayers they mention [[Cosmology of Dilaria/Gods/Higher Collective\|Higher Collective]] they believe to be a group of gods that watch over Dilaria. The main ideals of the religion are the same ideals as what [[Characters/Students of Tenazir\|Students of Tenazir]] proposed when they established [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]] and continued the teachings of [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]], these ideals are themed around personal growth and the relation between creation of law and obeying the law (law is sacred but because it is based on interpretation by men, it is flawed and just like men it need to be constantly improved).
- Most citizens of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia upper city\|Lenturia upper city]] are of the Elvish or infernal descent but Genasi and other less common innately attuned to magic races are present like Nikishikin.
- Citizens of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia Slums\|Lenturia Slums]] are either descendants of innately magical races whose connection to the weave isn't strong enough or are simply members of a race that isn't innately connected to the weave.
