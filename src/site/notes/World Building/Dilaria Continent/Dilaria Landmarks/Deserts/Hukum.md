- The harshest and the most deserted of the 3 deserts, only the most resilient (or stupid) adventurers venture into this desert in search of treasures and secrets, it's nearly perfectly flat but very rocky.
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Hukum\|Hukum]] has the lowest biodiversity out off all the deserts of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria\|Dilaria]].
