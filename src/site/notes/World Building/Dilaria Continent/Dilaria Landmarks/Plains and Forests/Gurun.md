- located south of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Sur\|Sur]] mountain range, thanks to the natural blockade that [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Sur\|Sur]] mountain range provides, [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Gurun\|Gurun]] plains experience only two seasons, the humid season (that lasts 33% of the year when the sun passes above the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Hukum\|Hukum]] desert) and the dry season (that lasts the other 66% of the year). 
- The dry season is a misnomer because even during it the Gurun plains are the most humid inhabited region of the world thanks to its large number of lakes and rivers. 
- On the southern outskirts of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Gurun\|Gurun]] plains there are two cities:
	- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] the city that is divided into 8 districts based on the schools of magic where new wizards and spells are born, unlike [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]] in [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] all races can study magic, regardless of their innate connection to the weave. 
	- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Subur folder/Subur\|Subur]] the city of artifice, created recently by artificers from [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] who were dissatisfied with the decision of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/District Court\|District Court]] which declined the proposal of creation of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Districts of Silden/District of Artifice\|District of Artifice]]
