Dilaria is a continent and the biggest exposed landmass on the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Glacier Plain\|Glacier Plain]]. 

Dilaria was shaped by the creation of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Artificial Sun\|Artificial Sun]] which orbits around the tallest mountain on the continent [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Asal Mountain\|Asal Mountain]] which is also the central point. The full orbit takes 360 days, which are divided into 36 [[Items & Concepts/Monoliths\|Monoliths]] each 10 days long.

Around [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Asal Mountain\|Asal Mountain]] there are three deserts:
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Bagus\|Bagus]] known for it's shattered ground caused by drying up of under-glacial rivers, when the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Glacier Plain\|Glacier Plain]] parted due to the creation of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Artificial Sun\|Artificial Sun]].
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Kiri\|Kiri]] known for its highlands made of sandstone, has the largest variety of animals and plants among all the deserts.
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Hukum\|Hukum]] the harshest and the most deserted of the 3 deserts, only the most resilient (or stupid) adventurers venture into this desert in search of treasures and secrets, it's nearly perfectly flat but very rocky.
The northern and southern edges of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/desert circle\|desert circle]] are walled of by two massive mountain ranges:
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Tigaraja\|Tigaraja]] limestone mountains that border [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Bagus\|Bagus]] desert and [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Veruna\|Veruna]] forest, these mountains are filled with karst caves.
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Sur\|Sur]] granite mountain range, the main region of the world where [[Items & Concepts/Salur\|Salur]] is being extracted, home to the dwarven stronghold [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Cairan folder/Cairan\|Cairan]] which controls most of the [[Items & Concepts/Salur\|Salur]] mining and selling.
Beyond the mountain ranges there are four lowland regions:
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Emas plains\|Emas plains]], with the exception of one massive terminal moraine, this region is extremely flat. Emas Plains are mainly inhabited and controlled by humans with their capital city [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Port Emas Folder/Port Emas\|Port Emas]] walled off from the rest of the continent by terminal moraine. People there focus on fishing and trade. It's relatively dry (compared to [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Gurun\|Gurun]] plains or [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Veruna\|Veruna]] forest) and experiences 4 seasons, extremely hot summer (when the sun is the closest), winter (when the sun is behind the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Asal Mountain\|Asal Mountain]]), spring and autumn (when the sun is either to the north or the south of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Asal Mountain\|Asal Mountain]]), because of that the agriculture is limited to the 3 seasons that are not summer.
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Veruna\|Veruna]] forest, hidden behind the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Tigaraja\|Tigaraja]] mountains, [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Veruna\|Veruna]] forest is nearly unexplored, what little is known is that it's very humid and lush. There are legends of ancient pre-[[Dilaria History/Historical Events/Melting\|Melting]] civilizations still living there, but [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturian scholars\|Lenturian scholars]] were not able to confirm that.
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Lenturia Plains\|Lenturia Plains]] located to the east of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/desert circle\|desert circle]] Lenturia plains are very dry and barren plains, in the middle of these plains there is a giant crystal that emits aura that amplifies innate magic. [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturian scholars\|Lenturian scholars]] claim that it has fallen from the sky and is of divine origin. Around this crystal people from races with innate connection to the weave like Elves have built a magical technocratic city [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]] that functions thanks to the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenari\|Lenari]], a group of powerful mages who have put themselves into an eternal trance so they can keep [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/thermal shield\|thermal shield]] that stimulates the climate around [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]] up.
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Gurun\|Gurun]] plains located south of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Sur\|Sur]] mountain range, thanks to the natural blockade that [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Sur\|Sur]] mountain range provides, [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Gurun\|Gurun]] plains experience only two seasons, the humid season (that lasts 33% of the year when the sun passes above the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Hukum\|Hukum]] desert) and the dry season (that lasts 66% of the year). The dry season is a misnomer because the Gurun plains are the most humid inhabited region of the world thanks to its large number of lakes and rivers. On the southern outskirts of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Plains and Forests/Gurun\|Gurun]] plains there are two cities:
	- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] the city that is divided into 8 districts based on the schools of magic where new wizards and spells are born, unlike [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]] in [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] all races can study magic, regardless of their innate connection to the weave. 
	- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Subur folder/Subur\|Subur]] the city of artifice, created recently by artificers from [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] who were dissatisfied with the decision of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/District Court\|District Court]] which declined the proposal of creation of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Districts of Silden/District of Artifice\|District of Artifice]]
The [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria\|Dilaria]] is surrounded by 5 mostly unmapped seas:
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Seas/Ringan\|Ringan]]
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Seas/Dolok\|Dolok]]
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Seas/Lahar\|Lahar]]
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Seas/Biru\|Biru]]
- [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Seas/Laut\|Laut]]
On the border of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Seas/Dolok\|Dolok]] and [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Seas/Lahar\|Lahar]] seas there is a large volcanic island called [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Pele\|Pele]], artificers from [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Subur folder/Subur\|Subur]] have sent few voyages there to learn about the creation of [[Items & Concepts/Artificial Salur\|Artificial Salur]] but they have been so far unsuccessful.
