- The clan's main activities include raiding (both [[Items & Concepts/terrestrial humanoids\|terrestrial humanoids]] and [[Items & Concepts/subterranean races\|subterranean races]]), druidcraft, hunting and agriculture
- The Clan lives inside moving tents that are pulled by [[Flora and Fauna/Fauna/Kabuto\|Kabuto]], these tents are mostly built out of bones, carapace and skin.
- The Clan follows the movement of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Artificial Sun\|Artificial Sun]], so they never end up directly under it.
- The Clan uses [[Items & Concepts/Salur\|Salur]] that they often steal during raids, they call it Nidia.
Characteristics of members of the clan:
- Members of the clan are often characterised by outsiders as brutal savages no different to [[Items & Concepts/subterranean races\|subterranean races]], but in reality members of the clan have close familial relationships and care a lot about their history, heritage and nature.

- The clan views magic as something sacred, a gift from their ancestors to help them survive in the harsh climates.

### History: 
- The specifics of the origin of the clan are currently unknown but it is believed that the [[Boreas Clan/Boreas Clan\|Boreas Clan]] lived inside icy caves of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Glacier Plain\|Glacier Plain]] before [[Dilaria History/Historical Events/Melting\|Melting]].
- There are legends of a powerful dragonborn who united the clan when they were still living inside the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Glacier Plain\|Glacier Plain]] but the details are unknown, in writing he is mentioned as a [[Characters/Unifier\|Unifier]].
- There are dungeons and temples left behind by the ancient [[Boreas Clan/Boreas Clan\|Boreas Clan]] underneath sands and underground, those that have been uncovered hint that the clan used to be much more technologically advanced than it currently is.
- Also based on the murals and statues inside these temples, scholars of the [[Boreas Clan/Boreas Clan\|Boreas Clan]] claim that the ancient members of the clan were deeply religious and believed in what in writing is called [[Cosmology of Dilaria/Gods/Sky Gods\|Sky Gods]] (the name itself is only an approximation since the original phrase hasn't been translated directly), however there have been very little information about what exactly these gods were.
