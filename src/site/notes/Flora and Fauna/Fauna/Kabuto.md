- Kabuto are the most common work animals on the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Kiri\|Kiri]] desert
- They are large, bulky and strong beetle like insects with large horns on their heads. 
- Only male ones are used for work as the female ones can attack with acid and their pheromones make males aggressive. 
- They are mostly used as beasts of burden mainly to pull vehicles.![Kabuto.png](/img/user/Images/Kabuto.png)
