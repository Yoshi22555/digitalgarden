- Falkatrias are large bipedal insects similar to praying mantis that are extremely fast and agile.
- Because of their lack of offensive abilities are very skittish. 
- They are commonly used as mounts when traversing deserts.
- They are insectivores, their specialized mouthparts that spread out while running into a sort of a net that captures small flying insects.
