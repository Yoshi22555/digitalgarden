- Created after the [[Player Character (Private)/Tryzan/Encountered Dungeons/Prototype Forge\|Prototype Forge]] but still around the same time, by the same creators.
- It was built to forge and train Arat, a powerful mechanised automaton whose main role was protection of the facility and of the ancient artefact which he held inside him. 
- This facility also held the forge that was capable of creating powerful runes that could enhance the powers of their users, this was placed in order to ensure that Arat could be stopped if he went rogue.
- This facility also became a research and development facility for the people who had created it, however at some point they all left.
- After the facility was abandoned and Arat was left to protect it, it got partially damaged by a purple wurm which died during the event.
- Similarly to the [[Player Character (Private)/Tryzan/Encountered Dungeons/Ancestral Fortress\|Ancestral Fortress]] there is no direct evidence of the origin of the creators, the technology they used is much more advanced than one used by the modern [[Boreas Clan/Boreas Clan\|Boreas Clan]], but it is said that their ancestors were more technologically advanced.
