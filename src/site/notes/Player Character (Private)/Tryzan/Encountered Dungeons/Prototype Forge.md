- Seems to be created around the same time as the [[Player Character (Private)/Tryzan/Encountered Dungeons/Ancestral Fortress\|Ancestral Fortress]], and uses the same runes as ones used there.
- It's main purpose was to create a powerful mechanical protector that would last for ages.
- The project was halted because of the destruction caused by earthquakes (possibly caused by purple wurms) and the prototype protector wasn't completed, however it was left in a semi-functional state.
- Creators of this vault moved to the deeper deeper parts of the cave system to try again.
