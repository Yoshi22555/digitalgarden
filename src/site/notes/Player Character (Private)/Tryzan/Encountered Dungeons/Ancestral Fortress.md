- A fortress created either before the melting or right after it.
- Its main purpose seems to be the protection of an ancient artefact, which according to [[Boreas Clan/Members/Seithr\|Seithr]] comes from the ancient [[Boreas Clan/Boreas Clan\|Boreas Clan]].
- The language used inside this fortress is unknown to Tryzan, however some runes look similar to the ones used by the modern [[Boreas Clan/Boreas Clan\|Boreas Clan]].
- Inside the fortress there were undead sentinels protecting it, they were under a spell, that was empowered by a vow, that forced them to protect this place after their deaths.
- The vault itself was protected by Artus, a powerful warrior and a magical doors that required someone to make a powerful vow in order to enter. These precautions seem to be placed to ensure that whoever takes the artefact, is strong, honest and responsible enough.
- After years of the fortress being uncared for, it began to decay along with the power of the spell that controlled the sentinels, this caused them to lose themselves and allowed intruders to overcome these defences. 
- There is no direct evidence that points towards to who the creators of this vault were, however the similarity of the runes to the modern [[Boreas Clan/Boreas Clan\|Boreas Clan]] runes, and [[Boreas Clan/Members/Seithr\|Seithr]]'s claims would suggest that it was built by the ancient [[Boreas Clan/Boreas Clan\|Boreas Clan]].
