- [[Player Character (Private)/Letty/Fauna/Kaiju and Leviathans/Regional Apexes/Regional Apex.\|Regional Apex.]] Predator of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Bagus\|Bagus]] desert where they pupate for the last time and reach their last stage of growth. 
- [[Player Character (Private)/Mearel/Things you've learned during your time as a nomad/Fauna Mearel/Kaiju and Leviathans/Regional Apexes/Examples/Myriarast\|Myriarast]]s have multiple growth stages, with long intervals of pupation in between them, their young and eggs haven't been observed yet so only their penultimate and ultimate stages are known.
- Reddish-brown, giant, segmented, invertebrates, they have 18 limbs, 14 legs for locomotion and 4 giant claws that are used for both bludgeoning and slashing. They are around 70 feet long and their carapace is quite flat. Their head is triangular and pointy. 
- Their shells are used to craft some of the most durable and expensive armour in [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria\|Dilaria]], while their heads are often displayed as trophies by people who have slayed them. 
- Usually to kill them cities send entire squads of soldiers up to 20 people to kill one.  
- Their diet mostly consists of carrion that fell into cracks inside [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/Bagus\|Bagus]] desert, but they are known to predate on other large invertebrates.
- They are EXTREMELY dangerous despite being mostly carrion feeders, they are aggressive to people, the current theory for their aggression states that they see people as a challenge to overcome in a show of dominance, some claim it is a sign of high intelligence. 
- Their hearts are made of crystal and are usually broken up into smaller pieces and sold as very expensive jewellery. 
- [[Player Character (Private)/Mearel/Things you've learned during your time as a nomad/Fauna Mearel/Kaiju and Leviathans/Regional Apexes/Examples/Myriarast\|Myriarast]]s are known to migrate after mating into other parts of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria\|Dilaria]], these migrations often caused problems in villages nearby the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/desert circle\|desert circle]] .
