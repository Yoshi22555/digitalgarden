- White with counter shade, fairly large (around 6 feet tall and up to 10 feet long) bulky segmented invertebrates
- They stand on two large legs, and have four arms that end in long claws for slashing. 
- Their tail is flat similarly to [[Player Character (Private)/Letty/Fauna/Kaiju and Leviathans/Regional Apexes/Examples/Myriarast.\|Myriarast.]] but unlike [[Player Character (Private)/Letty/Fauna/Kaiju and Leviathans/Regional Apexes/Examples/Myriarast.\|Myriarast.]], [[Player Character (Private)/Letty/Fauna/Non-Kaiju Fauna/Durirast.\|Durirast.]]s have flat heads with two giant tusks sticking towards the ground originating from the upper lips.
- Their sense of smell is even more sensitive than what dogs poses, but their eyesight is limited.
- They are a common target for experienced hunters. They are very defensive especially around their young but unlike what the common folk are saying, they aren't vicious killing machines.
