## [[Pre-Tenazir Era\|Pre-Tenazir Era]]:
- Information about this era is clouded by biases of religious texts and the passage of time so it's unreliable and partial 
- Time before [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Glacier Plain\|Glacier Plain]] was melted by the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Artificial Sun\|Artificial Sun]].
- During that time [[Items & Concepts/terrestrial humanoids\|terrestrial humanoids]] were enslaved by the [[Items & Concepts/subterranean races\|subterranean races]]
- During that time a powerful wizard [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]] decided rebel against the [[Items & Concepts/subterranean races\|subterranean races]] and gathered a party of powerful outlaws to escape. Among the people who helped him gather people and fight the oppressors there are few notable: Human [[Characters/Alexander Emas\|Alexander Emas]], Dwarven [[Characters/Cairan Family\|Cairan Family]] and [[Characters/Students of Tenazir\|Students of Tenazir]] a group of people who were innately attuned to weave. 
- After [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]] rallied his people and led them out of the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Asal Mountain\|Asal Mountain]] into the icy caves of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Glacier Plain\|Glacier Plain]]s he made a deal with [[Cosmology of Dilaria/Gods/Surtur\|Surtur]] to exchange his soul for the ability for his people to live in this frigid land.
- Legends say that [[Cosmology of Dilaria/Gods/Surtur\|Surtur]] took [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]]'s deal and created the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Artificial Sun\|Artificial Sun]] which now orbits around the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Asal Mountain\|Asal Mountain]].
## [[Tenazir Era\|Tenazir Era]]:
- Started after [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]] created the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Artificial Sun\|Artificial Sun]] in year 0
- During the [[Tenazir Era\|Tenazir Era]] members of his party ventured away from the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Asal Mountain\|Asal Mountain]] to run away from the blazing heat of the sun:
	- [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]]'s closest friend [[Characters/Alexander Emas\|Alexander Emas]] took humans and halflings and ventured out towards the western sea where he created a settlement that after his death was named [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Port Emas Folder/Port Emas\|Port Emas]]
	- A family of dwarves, who before [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]] were enslaved miners, took all their friends and families who like them were enslaved miners, and settled down in the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Sur\|Sur]] mountains where they established [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Cairan folder/Cairan Guild\|Cairan Guild]] that later grew into the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Cairan folder/Cairan\|Cairan]] stronghold that oversees the mining operations in [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Mountains/Sur\|Sur]] mountains, created a [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Cairan folder/Surtur church\|Surtur church]] and started to mine [[Items & Concepts/Salur\|Salur]] that became the foundation for long range travel across the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Deserts/desert circle\|desert circle]].
	- [[Characters/Students of Tenazir\|Students of Tenazir]] saw a blue flare to the east of the continent on the day [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]] created the sun and believed that it was the last message from [[Characters/Tenazir\|Tenazir]] and went to find its source. When they arrived, they found a massive meteorite that amplified their innate magical abilities. This discovery in later years caused people with innate magical abilities to flock towards the meteorite. This steady supply of people led to the creation of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]] city and the establishment of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenari\|Lenari]] mages who protect the city from the scorching heat of the sun.  
- Few hundred years after the establishment of the 3 major settlements, the people of Dilaria started to expand their reach:
	- People of Cairan expanded into the lush Gurun plains where they established the academical city of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] which was divided into 8 districts, each dedicated to a different school of magic. Unlike [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Lenturia Folder/Lenturia\|Lenturia]] [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] does not discriminate based on innate magical abilities, [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] became multicultural thanks to it being on a maritime trade route with [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Port Emas Folder/Port Emas\|Port Emas]]
	  - When [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]] was growing, a group of mainly Tieflings begun to expand on the knowledge of infernal and arcane constructs and artifacts. As this development grew, it became obvious to those who were leading it that a new district for artificers was necessary in [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/Silden\|Silden]], however the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/District Court\|District Court]] declined the proposal (officially [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Silden Folder/District Court\|District Court]] stated that it was unnecessary because artificers could study under in districts connected to the school of magic that correlated with the constructs and artifacts that the student was working on, however many people, especially artificers believe that it was because it would dilute the city funds even more which would cause each district to gain less money from taxes.) Because of this, artificers decided to create their own city that would be dedicated to the art of artifice, and thus creating [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Subur folder/Subur\|Subur]].
	  - After the discovery of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Pele\|Pele]] island by fishermen, which was filled with natural resources, the people of [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Port Emas Folder/Port Emas\|Port Emas]] ventured into the north and created [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Desa City Folder/Desa City\|Desa City]] which became the main port to where goods from [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Landmarks/Misc. Landmarks/Pele\|Pele]] were delivered to. Generally the relations between [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Port Emas Folder/Port Emas\|Port Emas]] and [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Desa City Folder/Desa City\|Desa City]] are friendly but the merchant guilds that rule over the [[World Building/Dilaria Continent/Dilaria Cities/Desa City Folder/Desa City\|Desa City]] often try to establish higher tariffs which often led to conflicts (sometimes even military)
